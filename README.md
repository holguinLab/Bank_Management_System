# 🏦 Bank Management System 💳  

**Bank Management System** is an interactive application designed to efficiently manage banks and accounts. With an intuitive menu, this system allows users to add, edit, and remove banks and accounts, as well as perform transfers and securely manage funds.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Bank Management**: Easily add, edit, view, and delete banks.  
✅ **Account Management**: Create, edit, and view accounts with detailed information.  
✅ **Banking Operations**: Transfer money, withdraw funds, and check balances in seconds.  
✅ **Secure PIN Generator**: A password generator with random characters for enhanced security.  

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project  
This application is modular, divided into three files:  
📂 **classes.py** - Contains all the necessary classes.  
📂 **functions.py** - Stores reusable functions.  
📂 **main.py** - The main file to run the program.  

To start the application, simply execute:  
```bash
python main.py
```  

## ⚠️ Error Handling  
This system is designed to **keep running even if errors occur**. I have implemented multiple `try-except` blocks and `while` loops with conditions to ensure that the program doesn't crash. If you find any bugs or unexpected behavior, feel free to report them—I truly appreciate your feedback! 🙌
